- CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
* The CIA triad is a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability

* Confidentiality—Only authorized users can access specific assets or data. To ensure confidential data remains safe, strict access controls that define who should and should not have access to data must be put in place.

* Integrity—the data is correct, authentic, and reliable. To maintain integrity, security professionals can safeguard data from being tampered with using a form of data protection like encryption.

* Availability - data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

  
- Risk, threats, vulnerabilities
- Risk: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset
- Threat: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets
- Vulnerability: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat

- Ethics and legal frameworks
Ethical concerns and laws related to counterattacks: The
United States' standpoint on counterattacks 
In the U.S., deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, among others. You can only defend. The act of counterattacking in the U.S. is perceived as an act of vigilantism. A vigilante is a person who is not a member of law enforcement who decides to stop a crime on their own. And because threat actors are criminals, counterattacks can lead to further escalation of the attack, which can cause even more damage and harm. Lastly, if the threat actor in question is a state-sponsored hacktivist, a counterattack can lead to serious international implications. A hacktivist is a person who uses hacking to achieve a political goal. The political goal may be to promote social change or civil disobedience. 

For these reasons, the only individuals in the U.S. who are allowed to counterattack are approved employees of the federal government or military personnel. 

International standpoint on counterattacks
The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which updates its guidance regularly, states that a person or group can counterattack if: 

The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.

The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.

The counterattack does not escalate the situation.

The counterattack effects can be reversed.

Organizations typically do not counterattack because the above scenarios and parameters are hard to measure. There is a lot of uncertainty dictating what is and is not lawful, and at times, negative outcomes are very difficult to control. Counterattack actions generally lead to a worse outcome, especially when you are not an experienced professional in the field.
